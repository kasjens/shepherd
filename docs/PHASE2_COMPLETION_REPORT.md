## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Memory Operations
```python
# Store and retrieve from local memory
await agent.store_memory("current_task", {"status": "analyzing", "progress": 0.3})
task_data = await agent.retrieve_memory("current_task")

# Add temporary findings
await agent.add_finding("performance_issue", {
    "metric": "response_time", 
    "value": 2.5, 
    "threshold": 1.0
})

# Share discoveries with other agents
await agent.share_discovery("optimization_opportunity", {
    "location": "database_query", 
    "improvement": "add_index",
    "estimated_speedup": "3x"
}, relevance=0.8)
```

### Agent Collaboration Scenarios
```python
# Agent receives shared context from others
discoveries = await agent.get_shared_context(context_type="discovery")
for discovery in discoveries:
    if discovery["metadata"]["relevance"] > 0.7:
        await agent.store_memory(f"shared_{discovery['key']}", discovery["data"])

# Real-time collaboration via pub/sub
async def handle_discovery(update):
    if update["metadata"]["relevance"] > 0.6:
        print(f"Relevant discovery from {update['metadata']['agent_name']}")

await shared_context.subscribe("agent_id", handle_discovery, {
    "context_type": "discovery",
    "relevance_min": 0.6
})
```
