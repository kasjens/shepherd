### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Direct Agent Messaging
```python
# Send notification to specific agent
await agent.send_message_to_agent(
    recipient_id, 
    MessageType.NOTIFICATION,
    {"message": "Task completed successfully"}
)

# Request-response pattern with timeout
response = await agent.send_request_to_agent(
    target_agent_id,
    "analyze_data", 
    {"dataset": "sales.csv"},
    timeout=30
)
```

#### 2. Peer Review System
```python
# Request peer review from qualified agents
review_id = await peer_review.request_review(
    requester_id,
    content={"code": "...", "documentation": "..."},
    review_criteria=["accuracy", "completeness", "security"],
    reviewer_count=2
)

# Automatic reviewer selection based on capabilities
# Consensus building from multiple reviews
# Structured feedback with improvement suggestions
```

#### 3. Broadcasting and Status Updates
```python
# Broadcast status to all agents
await agent.broadcast_status("working", {
    "current_task": "data_analysis",
    "progress": 0.75,
    "eta": "5 minutes"
})

# Share discoveries with relevance scoring
await agent.share_discovery("performance_issue", {
    "type": "memory_leak",
    "location": "module.py:42",
    "impact": "high"
}, relevance=0.9)
```

## Architecture Integration

### Memory System Integration
- **Communication artifacts stored in agent memory** for later reference
- **Discovery sharing through both memory and communication channels**
- **Status updates tracked in local memory** for agent awareness
- **Cross-agent context sharing** via both shared context pool and direct messaging

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **Timeout management** with configurable response windows
- **Message retry mechanisms** for failed deliveries
- **Error response generation** for failed requests
- **Graceful degradation** when communication manager unavailable
- **Statistics tracking** for monitoring communication health

### Performance Characteristics
- **Async message processing** with concurrent delivery
- **Message queuing** with configurable limits
- **Priority-based routing** for urgent communications
- **Conversation threading** for related message groups
- **Resource cleanup** for expired reviews and timeouts
